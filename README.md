# Angular Custom Form Validators

## About

This project was built to use as a reference example when working with custom form validators with Angular Reactive Forms.

New validators and example components will be added in the near future.

The goal is to explain how to perform custom or complex validations at different form levels (controls, groups or arrays)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
